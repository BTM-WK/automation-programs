Although global companies enter the overseas market with advanced quality and service,  they tend to struggle settling down.

WHY? = Failure on Culture Landing.It happens especially more in China and Korea.
Therefore, For a successful Brand Migration in Korea & China,
We need to get ready to prepare our Culture Landing.
Global companies such as Walmart, Carrefour, Unilever are the failure cases in Korea, where Gatorade fails in Japan.

Also, Korean’s overseas expansion showed failure in the early stage.
(Samsung, LG Electronics, Amore Pacific, CJ, LG Living Health, etc.)

[슬라이드 15]
We have been making successful stories for numbers of Global Companies by constructing Overseas “Brand Migration Platform”
Clients:
LG Electronics, CJ O’shopping, CJ OliveYoung, LION, Pulmuone, Bon-juk,
Hyundai Motor, KIA, Renault, Amore Pacific, KT&G, Kumho Tire.

Countries:
China, Turkey, Indo, Singapore, France, America, Vietnam
First step for Overseas Brand Migration: To grasp the consumer’s awareness, psychology, and behavior characteristic is the most important step to success.

But it is hard only with the general research results.
 LG, Samsung, CJ, Hyundai, Amore Pacific approached in this way, and ended up failing.

Numeracy is a very important component in business life but it isn’t the only component. Instinct, experience and judgment also matter. Luck, serendipity, brilliance, experience and courage play a major part. – Wally Olins, On Brand, 214-215

The numbers brigade will continue to crunch their dreary way through to greater influence. Most branding work will therefore be banal and mundane. - 215

Branding, should be creatively developed,
and emotionally echoed.
Successful adapting starts with successful diagnosis.

Until now, we have discussed about Adapting Phase, the most important stage of CBM.

One of the reason why famous global corporates such as Samsung, LG, CJ, Motorola had trouble settling in foreign countries, was that they haven’t examined this ‘Adapting Phase’.

If this stage has successfully worked out,
we will be establishing effective and strong success strategy through using WKMG’s fast & exquisite migration methods.

Next, we will discuss about the methods.
