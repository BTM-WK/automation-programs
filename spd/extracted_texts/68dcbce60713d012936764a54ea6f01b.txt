A&P Budget Allocation and Review

[슬라이드 3]
Achieved good level of aided recognition in a month 
   (Total group 37.4% / Target group 46.7%)
Gained positive ATRIX brand preference
   (3.8 out of 5, considered pretty good scoring)
Relatively low ATRIX purchase intention
   (Total group 3.3 / Target group 3.2)
1st TVC contributed to raise the recognition and preference of ATIX.
But it is difficult to change consumer’s brand attitude to MOTOROLA in a short period, which is a barrier to drive ATRIX sales.

1st TVC Review – Key Implications

[슬라이드 4]
Competitors(Samsung Galaxy S2, iPhone 4 White, Pantech Vega 3Generation) start their May-June intensive marketing activity. We need new campaign to counteract them.
In terms of effectiveness and efficiency of ad impression, exposing same advertising over three months causes tiredness.
Normally, campaigns have been moved based on 3-4 months PLC, 
   however; this ATRIX should be responsible for at least 6 months sales.(By Q3)
TVC change cycle of two big brands
Major brand’s share of spending
2nd TVC should be planed and executed
TV media (Terrestrial TV & Cable TV) is the strongest media in Korea and should be continued as a main media.
Competitors media execution overview

[슬라이드 5]
MOTOROLA brand tracking result
2nd TVC should be planed and executed
The specialty and benefit that is generated from the product should be communicated in more direct way
The cutting-edge image which is the essential consideration to purchase smart phone of MOTOROLA is weak. By ATRIX, should break the current perception of MOTOROLA and newly build the cutting-edge smartphone brand image.
Customers will not understand correctly neither purchase the ATRIX, unless precisely point the specialty and benefit of ATRIX because ATRIX is perfectly new concept of innovative product.

2nd TVC Direction – How to?
2 Options
of direct explanation
Demonstrative

Already has become 
the Apple's unique expression way
Testimonial

The best way to show benefits in simple 
and powerful way
The most effective way to directly communicate the specialty and benefit of ATRIX in the Korean market is TESTIMONIAL
Example of demonstrative AD : iPhone & Optimus
Example of testimonial AD : Febreze & McCafe

[슬라이드 7]
Celebrity is more effective in Korea even in the testimonial commercial.
 Using celebrity in an AD is one of the most powerful way to persuade Korean customers.
  Korean customers tend to trust and follow the direct use experience of celebrities, even it’s shown in AD 
  Also, it is possible to transfer the positive image of celebrity to the brand.

1st TVC Review – Key Implications

[슬라이드 33]
Currently, MOTOROLA’s brand status in the smartphone category is very low. Although the 1st campaign played positive role to make ATRIX’s USP understood, it is hard to improve its brand status in a very short time – one month.  Therefore, we need to communicate the ‘declaratory message’, which can revamp the worn-out brand image.
