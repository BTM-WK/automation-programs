However, they have two brand types and it distracts consumers’ cognition of HTC.

Prior communication strategy:
 As the leader of this industry, they demonstrated what other couldn’t do especially focusing on improvements/adds to prior version. 
It will be also applied to
  iphone 5
Prior communication strategy:
 they made their position ‘the opponent to Apple’ and have made the image that they are super ‘trend’ by emphasizing some comparative advantages-made because they are also manufacturer-and using Korea-localized content  
It will be continued
LG Optimus : To enter the leader group, they will launch a series of versions ; each one is ‘the first’ specialized in one technical benefit
SKY : they will continue ‘big model’ communication focused on the image
The big match ‘iphone VS. Samsung GALAXY’ will be continued 
But comparing the mania group of each companies,  APPLE is superior to Samsung

Lenovo, China’s biggest PC maker is establishing a new business section, 
 the Mobile-Internet Group(MIDH), to concentrate on emerging digital technologies, to bring strategic advantages to its mobile-Internet business. Lovono plans to develop and deliver new devices in the booming areas of cloud computing, smart TV and digital home devices, along with smartphone and tablets. Levono has already taken its first big step in the arena by revealing its first tablet called LePad, and the smartphone called LePhone.. The company has also opened its  own software apps store.

TV Commercial Issue
3. ATRIX Launching Campaign Direction
LAP TOP Dock is an important factor not only for the success of ATRIX, 
   but also to Re-Take off  MOTOROLA brand.
   · Why?
   : LAP TOP Dock will work as symbol, evidence that suggest the new start of MOTOROLA exactly.
Even LAP TOP Dock could not be exposed to TVCF during initial three months, it should be used as 
   2nd hero of the success in ATRIX.
But a problem is that a degree of understanding is too low unless the benefit and concept
   of LAP TOP Dock are suggested by video.
LAP TOP Dock is an important factor to Re-Take off MOTOROLA brand
And it should be used effectively.

[슬라이드 46]
TV CF Issue
3. ATRIX Launching Campaign Direction
To minimize the problem, WKMG suggests following operational strategy.
1. TVCF should be focused on a teaser AD for the early stage of launching period.
2. The message and scene of the teaser AD should be concentrated on ‘Docking’.
   (Scene and visual  applying to both HD Dock and LAP TOP Dock)
3. Operate media channels which can use video service intensively as an alternative of TVCF.
   [Recommendation]  PPL – It would have better effect than TVCF.
        · Theater AD
        · Internet Video Streaming Service
4. The general policy for all of media except TVCF is to expose the combination of ATRIX and HD Dock.
5. Secure the spaces for direct experience and manage it effectively.

Target Definition
4. XOOM Launching Campaign Direction
The strategy should to be focused on highly innovative consumers 
who has much interest in IT device and acceptance of tablet rather than common consumers 
because usages and pretexts of the category have not clearly set yet.
Common consumer & Innovative consumer’s cognition of XOOM
Target Profile – Upper Media Moguls & Tech-centrics
High portion of male 30s’ worker
 Lively information explorer as well as likes new IT devices
 High interest in camera, audio equipment, laptop e.t.c
Keep searching information about tablet from a tablet industry is started but not much portion of them bought it
Expected to start moving after the specs of iPad 2/Galaxy tap 2 are revealed and started sale.
Low Android understand
Overlapped usage with other devices
Willing to buy after price is decreased
Common Consumer
Have much interest and knowledge
 Recognize utility value of tablet
 Willingness to buy increases after use experience

(Tablet Users)
Low possibility to become potential customer
High possibility to become potential customer
